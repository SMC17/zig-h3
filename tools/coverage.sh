# tools/coverage.sh — measure line coverage of src/root.zig via kcov.
#
# Why a wrapper: the Zig 0.16 test runner's debug-info layout currently
# does not surface line-coverage to kcov on the nixpkgs build (which is
# compiled without libbfd-dev). Running kcov against a plain executable
# (the `coverage-driver` exe defined in build.zig + examples/) works
# cleanly because it has standard ELF + DWARF, no test-runner inlining.
#
# The driver exercises every public function and every public error
# path in src/root.zig — see examples/coverage_driver.zig.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/coverage.sh             # build + run + print line %
#   bash tools/coverage.sh --html      # also keep the HTML report
#
# Requires: kcov, jq, zig 0.16.
